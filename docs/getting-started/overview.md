# Overview

Kastle is a text adventure engine. You can use it to run games in your terminal where you'll impersonate a hero and will instruct them about what to do by writing text commands.

You can also use Kastle as a platform to develop your own text adventures.

## Features

- **Portable**: Kastle runs on the JVM. Every computer with Java installed can run Kastle;
- **Simple**: Kastle games are simple jar files. The `kastle install` command will take care of managing the games;
- **Narrative based**: in Kastle there's no fight system. This leads to strongly narrative oriented games with fun stories and mechanics;
