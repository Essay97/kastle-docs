# Install a game
The simplest way to find Kastle games is to check out the [Kastle Games Vault](https://github.com/Essay97/kastle-gamevault) repository.

There, you'll find a curated list of games available to play on Kastle, each with documentation to help you install it.

 Kastle game is simply a JAR file, so some authors may choose to distribute their games in other ways (for example, on their personal website). Generally, the syntax to install a Kastle game is:

```bash
kastle install <game title> <game class> <game file>
```

**Game title** is arbitraryâ€”you can choose whatever you like. **Game class** must be provided by the author, and **game file** is the name of the downloaded file containing the game.
