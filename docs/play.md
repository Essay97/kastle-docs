# Players guide
Here begins your journey as a Kastle player! You’ll find yourself immersed in a variety of worlds and settings, experiencing countless stories shaped by your own decisions. And if you ever want to live an adventure that doesn’t exist yet, you can become a Kastle game developer and write it yourself.

This tutorial picks up after you’ve [installed your games](/docs/getting-started/install-games). Here, you’ll learn how to navigate, manage, and run your installed games, as well as the actual commands you need to play.

## Listing games
You can list all the installed games by running `kastle list`.
