# Overview

**Kastle** is a text adventure engine. You can use it to play games in your terminal, where you take on the role of a hero and control their actions by typing text commands.

You can also use Kastle as a platform to develop your own text adventures.

## Features

- **Portable**: Kastle runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), so it works on any computer with Java installed.
- **Simple**: Kastle games are simple jar files. The `kastle install` command manages game installation for you.
- **Narrative based**: Kastle focuses on storytelling—there’s no combat system. This leads to highly narrative-driven games with engaging stories and creative mechanics.
- **Endless possibilities**: Kastle is not tied to any specific lore or genre. Any story involving a player navigating and interacting with an environment can be told with Kastle. Rescue the princess, repair a spaceship, explore a western town—your imagination is the only limit.
- **Customizable**: creating a Kastle game is easy thanks to its powerful Kotlin-based DSL. Just install the tools and get started in minutes!
